# Agent State — Cross-Session Handoff

**Date**: 2026-04-25
**HEAD on master**: `aea6a7c` (push verified)
**Honest score**: 89.5 → ~96 across 13 dimensions after Phase 1 + Phase 2 + final batch (G99 + G132)
**Source-of-truth catalogue**: `.research/final-138-gap-catalogue.md` (138 gaps, 25-pass audit)

This document lets a fresh post-compact session dispatch follow-up work without re-loading agent context from scratch. Read this first; then read `final-138-gap-catalogue.md` only for the specific gaps a new task needs.

## Agent Roster

### Agent A — Code Executor (`abfc681ee03d483c0`)

- **Role**: Executor — TDD-first, path-form commits, plain-merge on push reject, NEVER `--rebase`. Writes code, runs `go vet ./... && go test ./... -count=1`, commits, pushes.
- **Catalogue scope owned** (sections of `final-138-gap-catalogue.md`):
  - Plugin scope (Plugin#1-23)
  - Production readiness (P1, P2, P4)
  - STRIDE/Perf (R1, R3)
  - Trading-domain (T2, T4, T5, T7)
  - Go-idiom (E1, E4) — partial
  - Pen-test/DR (DR-3, AI-1, AI-2)
  - ISO 25010 Compatibility (G99 — session fixation)
  - Pass 24 (G132 — user-arg LLM sanitization)
  - DPDP regulatory series (DPDP1, DPDP2, DPDP3)
  - Event sourcing (ES-billing, ES-paper, ES-outbox, T4)
  - DDD Family aggregate (D-series partial)
- **Last commit on master**: `aea6a7c` — `feat(security): sanitize user-args reflected to LLM (G132)`
- **Authored commits this batch** (newest first):
  - `aea6a7c` G132 — user-arg sanitization (4 files, +125/-5)
  - `08e9833` G99 — session fixation regen (4 files, +192/-9)
  - `5b3d0da` E1+E4 — sentinel %w + email hash in errors
  - `61cea34` Plugin#4+5+14 — event installed-flag + watcher logging + handler panic isolation
  - `0a94dbc` T5 — optional pre-trade margin check
  - `14c6cf5` T2 — pre-trade circuit-limit check
  - `1e7c7fa` T4 — OrderFilledEvent Status field
- **Specific gaps still owed** (catalogue ID + LOC estimate):
  - `C1` — context.Background() mid-flight in adapters, ~40 LOC actual / ~200 LOC including ctx propagation through `app/adapters.go` callsites. **DEFERRED** in `5b3d0da` commit (split out from E1+E4 because it cascades through 8+ callsites — safer as standalone PR).
  - `Plugin#9` — Watcher goroutine NOT joined on Stop (CRIT, ~10 LOC) — still owed.
  - `Plugin#13` — Tool name collision unguarded in GetAllTools (~15 LOC).
  - `T1` — place_order no market-hours rejection (~30 LOC).
  - `T7` — Telegram retry/DLQ/fallback (~80 LOC).
  - `P2` — broker 429 / Retry-After propagation (~60 LOC).
  - `B1` — Audit buffer drops entries silently (~30 LOC, compliance gap).
  - `DB1` — SQLite FK enforcement OFF (~5 LOC PRAGMA + ~50 LOC FK constraints).
  - `Pen-1` — Stolen JWT read-abuse invisible to circuit breaker (~60 LOC).
- **If resumed brief** (1-line): "Resume executor scope from HEAD `aea6a7c`. Pick next item from `agent-state.md` Agent A `still owed` list — recommend `C1` (cleanest follow-on to `5b3d0da`) or `Plugin#9` (closes a CI-flake CRIT). TDD-first per `.claude/CLAUDE.md`; path-form commits with `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>`; STOP if estimate exceeds 50%."

### Agent B — Read-Only Auditor (`a64b2771b9c6e6d68`)

- **Role**: Read-only researcher — performs N-pass adversarial audits, writes `.research/*.md` deliverables, does NOT touch source. Output is gap catalogues + scorecards consumed by Agent A.
- **Catalogue scope owned** (sections of `final-138-gap-catalogue.md` originated by this agent):
  - Pass 6 DDD/SOLID inventory (D1-D7, S1-S6)
  - Pass 7 adversarial verification (Plugin#9/#14 promotion to CRIT)
  - Pass 11 STRIDE/Perf/DPDP (R1-R3, DPDP1-3, M1, DX1)
  - Pass 12 customer journey (Pen-1/2/3, DR-1/2/3, AI-1/2, Sus-1/2)
  - Pass 13 trading-domain (T1-T11)
  - Pass 14 CI/release (J1-J8)
  - Pass 15 Go-idiom (E1, E2, E4, C1, N1)
  - Pass 16 DB/crypto/container (DB1)
  - Pass 17 ROI re-rank → sprint plan
  - Pass 18 ceiling challenge
  - Pass 19 meta-research reconciliation (G86-G88)
  - Pass 20 adversarial recheck (A1-A3, B1-B3)
  - Pass 21 ISO 25010 Compat+Port (G93-G100, including G99)
  - Pass 22 12-Factor/NIST/CWE (G101-G107)
  - Pass 23 enterprise governance (G108-G120)
  - Pass 24 DORA/chaos/cost/lock-in/strategic-DDD (G121-G135, including G132)
  - Pass 25 FedRAMP/ISO27001/SOC2/PCI (G136-G143)
- **Last commit on master**: `a4feb5b` — `docs(research): final 138-gap catalogue from 25-pass audit` (sole commit; this agent is read-only by charter).
- **Specific gaps still owed** (research deliverables, NOT code fixes):
  - **Validation pass** — re-audit gaps closed by `08e9833` (G99) and `aea6a7c` (G132). Confirm session fixation closure across all `CompleteSession` callers; confirm sanitization covers all user-arg echo sites beyond watchlist + trailing.
  - **Phase 3a scoping doc** — Manager port migration (S2 keystone): 168 `*kc.Manager` occurrences in `mcp/`, ~600 LOC. Needs incremental migration plan (suggested: 5 batches of ~33 sites, ordered by tool risk).
  - **C1 propagation map** — enumerate the 8 `context.Background()` sites in `app/adapters.go:180,220,229,263,271,278,340,372` with proposed ctx-bearing call signatures. Deliverable: `.research/c1-ctx-propagation-plan.md`.
  - **92 remaining gaps re-prioritization** — of the original 138 minus closed (PR-A through PR-MR + Block 1-4 + final batches G99/G132 ≈ 46 closed), 92 remain. ROI-rerank against shipped baseline.
- **If resumed brief** (1-line): "Resume read-only auditor scope. Source-of-truth: `.research/final-138-gap-catalogue.md`. Next deliverable: pick from Agent B `still owed` — recommend C1 propagation map (unblocks Agent A) OR Phase 3a Manager port migration scoping. Output to `.research/<topic>.md`. NEVER touch source files; NEVER commit anything but `.research/*.md` docs."

## Pending After This Session

| Item | LOC | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 — ctx propagation in adapters | ~200 | Agent A | DEFERRED (split from `5b3d0da`); needs Agent B propagation map first ideally |
| Phase 3a — Manager port migration (S2 keystone) | ~600 | Agent A (after Agent B scopes batches) | Pre-work — 168 sites in `mcp/*.go` import `*kc.Manager` |
| Remaining 92 gaps from 138-catalogue | ~3500 | Both | ROI-reranked sprint plan in `final-138-gap-catalogue.md` §4 |

**Closed this session via final batch**:
- `G99` — closes a real OWASP A07 (session fixation) vuln. Score lift: meaningful.
- `G132` — closes prompt-injection echo vector (4 highest-risk sites). Score lift: defence-in-depth.

**Cumulative score trajectory**:
- Pre-Phase 1: 89.5
- Post-Phase 1+2 (PR-A through PR-MR + Block 1-4): ~95
- Post final batch (G99, G132, T2/T5/T4, Plugin#4/5/14, E1/E4): ~96
- Cost-justified ceiling: ~97.5 (per catalogue §1)
- True 100: mathematically unbounded

## Standing Rules (apply to both agents on resume)

1. Path-form commits per concern: `git commit -o -- <files> -m "<msg>"`.
2. Plain merge if push rejects; NEVER `git pull --rebase`.
3. TDD-first per `.claude/CLAUDE.md`: red → impl → green.
4. `go vet ./... && go test ./... -count=1` green before push.
5. STOP if either time or LOC exceeds estimate by 50%; report what landed.
6. Co-Authored-By trailer: `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>`.
7. SAC (Smart App Control) workaround on Windows: rotate `GOTMPDIR=/tmp/<tag>_$i GOCACHE=/tmp/<tag>_$i` cache dirs in retry loop when fresh test binaries blocked.
8. Agent B is read-only — produces `.research/*.md` only. Code execution always Agent A.
