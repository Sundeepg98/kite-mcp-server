# INDEX.md — Question-Keyed Research Lookup

**Date**: 2026-05-11 IST
**Master HEAD audited**: `91d834f` (`docs(verification): empirical re-verification across 16 active research docs`)
**Production**: v1.3.0 / tools=111 / machine version 273 / image `deployment-01KR9FPJC88YA80VWS7VMTWTY7`
**Scope**: 7 research locations covered (`.research/` active + archive, user `memory/`, `MEMORY.md`, repo root, `docs/`, project + repo `CLAUDE.md`)
**Charter**: question-keyed (not file-keyed) lookup so future sessions can answer "what's X?" without re-spawning research agents.

**Verification protocol** per row:
- **Last verified**: date of last empirical or web-source verification (or *unverified/derived* if no probe-date is cited)
- **Status**: **FRESH** (verified ≤30d) / **STALE-PENDING** (verified >30d, may need re-check) / **EMPIRICAL** (probe-able now via the listed `Probe path`) / **NARRATIVE** (judgment-load-bearing, not empirically falsifiable) / **SUPERSEDED** (older claim; see referenced newer entry)
- **Probe path**: command/URL to re-verify if empirical

## §0 — How to use this doc

1. **For a known question**: ctrl-F or `grep` the question column. Each row points to the canonical answer file:section + last-verified date. If status is STALE-PENDING and decision is high-stakes, re-probe before asserting.
2. **For an unknown topic**: skim the §1 research-streams overview to find the right stream; then dive into that stream's docs.
3. **For a stale-finding cleanup pass**: filter rows with `Status: STALE-PENDING` and re-verify the Probe path; promote to FRESH on success.
4. **When adding new research**: pick the right category in §2-§9. If no row matches, add one. Entries with overlapping answers in multiple files should pick the canonical-source row by (most recent verification > most empirically grounded > most cross-referenced).
5. **When archiving research**: update the affected rows' Answer location to `.research/archive/<topic>/<file>.md` so the lookup still works post-archival.

## §6 — Technical / Architecture

| Question | Answer location | Last verified | Status | Probe path |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| What's the production state right now? | `.research/STATE.md` §1.1 + `.research/production-master-gap-report.md` | 2026-05-11 | EMPIRICAL | `curl https://kite-mcp-server.fly.dev/healthz` |
| v1.3.0 / tools=111 / Fly.io BOM region / machine version 273 / image `deployment-01KR9FPJC88YA80VWS7VMTWTY7` / deployed 2026-05-10 17:44 UTC against commit `bc5043e`. Master HEAD `91d834f` is 5 commits ahead — all `.research/`-only (excluded from Docker context). **NO deploy gap exists.** | (same) | (same) | (same) | (same) |
| How many MCP tools does the production binary register? | `.research/STATE.md` §1.1 + `.research/production-master-gap-report.md` §1.4 | 2026-05-11 | EMPIRICAL | `wsl bash -c "cd /mnt/d/Sundeep/projects/kite-mcp-server && go build -o /tmp/kmcp . && /tmp/kmcp 2>&1 \| head -5"` |
| **111** = 93 registered + 18 gated_trading (when ENABLE_TRADING=false). **NOT 130** — that's a `grep mcp.NewTool(` over `mcp/` which counts 19 test fixtures in `_test.go` files. Always compile-and-run, never grep-and-count. Methodology rule pinned at `.research/STATE.md` §11. | (same) | (same) | (same) | (same) |
| How many algo2go modules are external? | `.research/STATE.md` §1.1 + `memory/session_2026-05-10_path-a-complete.md` | 2026-05-11 | EMPIRICAL | `ls D:/Sundeep/projects/algo2go/ \| wc -l` |
| **28** modules: alerts, aop, audit, billing, broker, clockport, cqrs, decorators, domain, eventsourcing, i18n, instruments, isttz, legaldocs, logger, money, oauth, papertrading, registry, riskguard, scheduler, sectors, telegram, templates, ticker, usecases, users, watchlist. Path A inauguration COMPLETE (v252 with kc/sectors → A.27 added clockport on top). | (same) | (same) | (same) | (same) |
| How many in-tree workspace members? | `.research/STATE.md` §1.1 + `go.work` | 2026-05-11 | EMPIRICAL | `cat go.work \| grep -E "^\s*\./"` |
| **4** (root + plugins + testutil + app/providers). Was 30 (initial) → 11 (mid-Path-A post A.20) → 4 (post A.27 clockport closure). | (same) | (same) | (same) | (same) |
| What's the Tier 1 closure-DI state? | `.research/STATE.md` §1.2 + `.research/STATE-claims-audit-2026-05-11.md` (verifies SHAs) | 2026-05-11 | EMPIRICAL | `git log -1 34a32bf fd4b20e 650f4c3` |
| **CLOSED.** Tier 1.1 brokers (`34a32bf`, 8 closure pairs) + Tier 1.2 eventing (`fd4b20e`, 16 closure pairs) + Tier 1.3 scheduling (`650f4c3`, 4 closure pairs). 2 facades remain deferred (StoreRegistry + SessionLifecycleService). | (same) | (same) | (same) | (same) |
| What's the Tier 2 pure-function registrar state? | `.research/STATE.md` §1.2 + `.research/STATE-v2-fresh-eyes.md` §3 | 2026-05-11 | EMPIRICAL | `git log --oneline | grep "Tier 2"` |
| **CLOSED.** 8 total pure-function registrars (1 pre-existing precedent + 7 extracted, OAuth + 6 sub-registrars). Unit tests added at `1c54773 test(kc/manager): add unit tests for 7 pure-function registrars (closes C3)`. | (same) | (same) | (same) | (same) |
| What's the Phase 2.x persistence factory state? | `.research/STATE.md` §1.3 + `.research/phase-2-6-r10-decisions.md` v8 | 2026-05-11 | EMPIRICAL | `cat app/providers/alertdb.go \| head -60` |
| **Phase 2.6 architecturally CLOSED.** `ProvideAlertDB` factory accepts `Driver=sqlite\|postgres\|turso` via env switch. SQLite default (production runs this). Postgres adapter (Phase 2.0-2.5) shipped + `OpenLibSQL` constructor (Phase 2.6 Path 6) shipped at `algo2go/kite-mcp-alerts d3c2a4a`. **libsql-client-go has GitHub deprecation banner BUT is the right choice for our CGO-free pure-remote architecture.** Production stays on SQLite (`Driver` unset → default branch). Step 4 (test/dev Fly deploy) SKIPPED — defensible engineering. | (same) | (same) | (same) | (same) |
| What's the Path E try-before-buy result (Turso vs DO)? | `.research/path-e-try-before-buy-results.md` | 2026-05-10 | FRESH | external — re-probe Turso/DO dashboards |
| Track 1 (Turso aws-ap-south-1): COMPLETED — hello-world succeeded; 5 min signup; $0; Mumbai region listed. Track 2 (DO BLR1, fresh account): **FALSIFIED** — DO docs claim BLR1 supports managed Postgres but UI showed only NA/EU regions. Track 3 (1-week synthetic load): NOT STARTED. | (same) | (same) | (same) | (same) |
| What's the 10K-agent capacity blocker analysis? | `.research/10000-agent-blocker-analysis.md` | 2026-05-06 | STALE-PENDING (some claims have stale paths post Path A) | NARRATIVE |
| 5 layers (Regulatory / Infrastructure / Data+Auth / Dev Coordination / Operational). Cost ceiling collapsed 75% post-corrections (₹3.5-4.5L/mo → ~₹50K/mo founder-only). Calendar: 6-12mo solo / 3-6mo Pre-Seed-funded. Two empirical corrections: (a) Whitelisted-IPs field is plural (multi-cell-friendly); (b) SEBI 10/sec is per-(user-app) not per-operator (BYO-developer-app architecture is naturally per-user-segregated). | (same) | (same) | (same) | (same) |
| What's the Phase 3 multi-cell first step? | `.research/STATE.md` §3.1 + `.research/forward-tracks-strategic-review.md` Track 1 | 2026-05-11 | NARRATIVE | `flyctl machines clone <bom-id> --region bom -a kite-mcp-server` |
| **Trigger NOT fired** (need ≥100 sustained concurrent users; we are at 0 paid). Smallest first step: `flyctl machines clone` — single command, ~60-90s, ~₹30/day, same static egress IP, dual-purpose with HN-surge prep. Cost ceiling: 2 cells ₹1-2k/mo → 5 cells ₹2.5-5k/mo → 10 cells ₹5-10k/mo → 100 cells ₹50k-1L/mo. | (same) | (same) | (same) | (same) |
| What's the OAuth callback flow? | `memory/kite-callback-deepdive.md` + `docs/callback-deep-dive-13-levels.md` (full 237KB archive) | 2026-03 | STALE-PENDING | external (kite.trade may change) |
| Three callback URLs: (1) Kite→Server `/callback`; (2) Server→localhost `:3334/oauth/callback` for mcp-remote; (3) `/auth/browser-login` for ops dashboard. Single `/callback` multiplexed by `flow` param (oauth/browser/default). 8-step OAuth flow: 401 → discovery → dyn client reg → /oauth/authorize (packs state into redirect_params) → Kite login → /callback (HMAC verify + auth code) → JS redirect → /oauth/token (PKCE). `redirect_params` piggyback trick: `oauthState{ClientID,RedirectURI,CodeChallenge,State}` JSON→base64→HMAC-SHA256→smuggled through Kite's redirect_params. | (same) | (same) | (same) | (same) |
| What's the agent-domain map? | `.research/agent-domain-map.md` | 2026-05-09 | STALE-PENDING (header line 16 cites stale "v228 LIVE; tools=130; 40-deploy") | NARRATIVE |
| 5 canonical roles: `chain` (deploys), `audit` (feature TDD), `path-a-owner` (module promotion), `playwright` (visual verification), `capacity-architect` (research). Each role has owns-exclusively + forbidden-paths. Disjoint-scope conventions for parallel dispatch. **Header production state needs refresh** per `.research/active-docs-verification-2026-05-11.md` §2. | (same) | (same) | (same) | (same) |
| What's the multi-broker abstraction plan? | `memory/kite-next-roadmap.md` §"Multi-Broker Abstraction" + `docs/multi-broker-plan.md` | 2026-04-03 | STALE-PENDING | NARRATIVE |
| 3-4 month effort. `broker.Client` interface already exists; need adapters for Angel One (smartapigo SDK exists), Dhan (godhanhq SDK exists), Upstox. Zerodha 15.76% market share, Angel One 16.3%, Groww 18.9% (no API yet). All 78 tools + paper trading + backtesting + riskguard + Telegram + audit-trail are broker-agnostic in logic. | (same) | (same) | (same) | (same) |

| **R2 backup chain healthy** (Litestream PID 645 actively replicating, 10s sync interval, R2 endpoint with bom region `auto`). Schema integrity OK + 27 tables + hkdf_salt 64-hex (32 bytes) PRESENT. **2 operational gaps**: (a) GitHub repo Actions secrets unset → monthly cron fails at env-var gate (run id 25205029746 failed in 11s); (b) `cmd/dr-decrypt-probe` source dir does NOT exist → playbook Item 2 build will fail. | (same) | (same) | (same) | (same) |

| Day-1 +12h primary: r/algotrading (1.86M subs, OSS-friendly, no AI-content ban). Drop r/Zerodha (350 subs, restricted), r/programming (3 rules close us out). r/IndianStockMarket has hard "no AI-generated content" rule (2026-04-23) — frame as developer tool, not AI assistant. **User has NO Reddit account `Sundeepg98`** (verified 2026-05-02 reddit.com 404) — **must create + 6-day warmup** for ≥30-50 comment karma to escape new-account auto-shadowban. | (same) | (same) | (same) | (same) |

| Why rename to Algo2Go? | `memory/kite-algo2go-rename.md` | 2026-04-17 | STALE-PENDING | external (TM database) |
| Zerodha owns "Kite" TM Class 36 + 42; we're unambiguously infringing once revenue appears. Algo2Go: domain available, TM available (Class 36/42), GitHub user/org available, npm/PyPI available. Backup name: **Tradarc** (coined wordmark, strongest as non-descriptive). **Note**: `algo2go-reservation-runbook.md` 2026-05-03 found `tradarc.com` IS REGISTERED to Server Plan Srl since 2001-05-04 — backup not clean. | (same) | (same) | (same) | (same) |

| Observability layer for AI-assisted trading. NOT a trading terminal (Kite does that), NOT a chat interface (Claude does that). Flight recorder. Unique value: AI activity audit trail + alert lifecycle + tool usage analytics + cross-session history + multi-user overview + credential mgmt.

Reuses `~/.claude/plugins/local/kite-trading/`. Dual-publish: plugin (slash commands) + skills folder (drop into user config). | (same) | (same) | (same) | (same) |
| Where's the README hero claim integrity table? | `.research/active-docs-verification-2026-05-11.md` §11 + `.research/final-pre-launch-verification.md` Phase 2 | 2026-05-11 | EMPIRICAL | `head README.md` |

| Where are the show-hn body + replies? | `docs/show-hn-post.md` | unverified-after-edit | STALE-PENDING (numbers may need refresh) | `wc -l docs/show-hn-post.md` |
| 3 title options + 500-word body + 13 prepared replies. Numbers (110+ tools, 11 RiskGuard, ~9k tests) need cross-check vs current README before final submit. | (same) | (same) | (same) | (same) |

## §9 — Session Lessons + Standing Rules

| Question | Answer location | Last verified | Status | Probe path |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Why "compile-and-run" beats "grep-and-count"? | `.research/STATE.md` §5.6 + `.research/STATE.md` §11 + `.research/production-master-gap-report.md` §1.5 | 2026-05-11 | FRESH | NARRATIVE — methodology rule |
| `grep -rE 'mcp\.NewTool\("' mcp/` returns 130 raw matches but 19 of those are in `_test.go` fixtures, never registered in production. Correct method: compile-and-run binary, read `Tool registration complete registered=N excluded=N gated_trading=N total_available=N` startup log line. The flawed STATE.md "tools=130 in-tree" claim caused 4 consecutive synthesis dispatches to recommend "production deploy is the #1 unblock" against a non-existent gap. **Cost: ~6 hours of misdirected synthesis.** Lesson is durable — applies to ANY grep-derived metric (test counts, riskguard checks, etc.). | (same) | (same) | (same) | (same) |
| Why "WSL2 mandatory for go test/build"? | `memory/feedback_wsl_for_go_test.md` + `memory/MEMORY.md` line 24 | 2026-05-04 | FRESH-NARRATIVE | external (WSL2 vs Windows-native test results) |
| Windows-native is SAC-flaky (50-70% failure rate); WSL2 is reliable. Every brief that runs `go test` MUST direct the agent to WSL2. Never fall back to Windows-native; defer instead. | (same) | (same) | (same) | (same) |
| Why "no git stash anywhere"? | `memory/feedback_no_stash_anywhere.md` + `memory/MEMORY.md` line 17 | 2026-04 | FRESH-NARRATIVE | NARRATIVE |
| WSL2 verification mirror, source-of-truth tree, any clone — stash is forbidden everywhere. Functional risk identical regardless of which working tree. Use worktrees per agent for isolation when 3+ concurrent agents. | (same) | (same) | (same) | (same) |
| What's the team-agent commit protocol? | `memory/user_team_commit_protocol.md` + `memory/MEMORY.md` line 20 | 2026-04 | FRESH-NARRATIVE | NARRATIVE |
| For team-agent sessions on a SHARED repo: use `git commit -o -- <paths>` + plain merge (NEVER `git add -A`, NEVER `git pull --rebase`). For scale / safety-first: per-teammate git worktrees via `scripts/agent-worktree-init.sh`. | (same) | (same) | (same) | (same) |
| When do research agents hit diminishing returns? | `memory/feedback_research_diminishing_returns.md` + `memory/MEMORY.md` reference | 2026-04-17 | FRESH-NARRATIVE | NARRATIVE |
| ~10-agent mark on a given question. Public-internet research hits ceiling for niche topics (SEBI, Indian fintech). After ~10 research agents, shift to execution. Adversarial / alternative-framing extracts more value than "go deep on X". Exception: single facts that block ₹1L+ decisions. | (same) | (same) | (same) | (same) |
| Why "main agent is orchestrator only"? | `memory/user_agent_orchestration_rule.md` + `memory/MEMORY.md` line 5 | 2026-04 | FRESH-NARRATIVE | NARRATIVE |
| All research and concrete execution work goes through sub-agents; main session dispatches, synthesizes, tracks state. Exception: trivial orientation reads + single-line health checks. | (same) | (same) | (same) | (same) |
| Why "reuse research agents for execution via SendMessage"? | `memory/user_agent_reuse_for_execution.md` + `memory/MEMORY.md` line 6 | 2026-04 | FRESH-NARRATIVE | NARRATIVE |
| When research agent has found actionable work, ping back via SendMessage to execute rather than spawning fresh execution agent. Preserves researched state; saves orchestrator context. | (same) | (same) | (same) | (same) |
| Why "default to team agents for 3+ concurrent agents"? | `memory/user_team_agents_default.md` + `memory/MEMORY.md` line 19 | 2026-04 | FRESH-NARRATIVE | NARRATIVE |
| Set up Claude Code team config at session start (not mid-flight) when 3+ agents work on shared codebase. Ad-hoc `Agent()` + `SendMessage` produces concurrent-edit friction. | (same) | (same) | (same) | (same) |
| Why "trust empirical over research scoping"? | `memory/feedback_research_vs_empirical_grounding.md` + `memory/MEMORY.md` line 23 | 2026-04 | FRESH-NARRATIVE | NARRATIVE |
| When research agent's pattern-survey says "easy fix" and executor's empirical code-read flags structural blockers, the executor wins. Dispatch executor to verify dependency graph BEFORE committing to research-recommended cleanups <100 LOC. | (same) | (same) | (same) | (same) |
| Why "decoupling investments — agent-concurrency denominator, not user-MRR"? | `memory/feedback_decoupling_denominator.md` + `memory/MEMORY.md` line 22 | 2026-04 | FRESH-NARRATIVE | NARRATIVE |
| When analyzing architectural decoupling patterns (DI containers, logger interfaces, middleware split, full ES), evaluate ROI against multi-agent parallel-dev velocity, NOT user-revenue. Drop "ceremony"/"premature" prejudging labels; state preconditions explicitly. | (same) | (same) | (same) | (same) |
| What's the cheapest compliance action? | `memory/feedback_cheapest_compliance_action.md` + `memory/kite-landmines.md` "Bottom line" | 2026-04-17 | STALE-PENDING-but-durable-recommendation | NARRATIVE |
| Email `kiteconnect@zerodha.com` with 3 questions before any monetization. ₹0 cost. Establishes paper trail. Flips legal posture from "unauthorized operator" to "in-process compliance review". Pre-drafted at `docs/drafts/zerodha-compliance-email.md`. | (same) | (same) | (same) | (same) |
| Why "no Foundation email in product work"? | `memory/user_email_rule.md` + `memory/MEMORY.md` line 4 | standing | FRESH-NARRATIVE | NARRATIVE |
| `g.karthick.renusharmafoundation@gmail.com` is Foundation-context only; must NOT appear in any product communication, signature, config, or draft. | (same) | (same) | (same) | (same) |

None: Claude Code (terminal), Cursor, Continue, Zed, Cline, RooCode, Windsurf, 5ire. **`ui://` is NOT in core MCP spec** — Anthropic-originated extension. PR `modelcontextprotocol/specification#518` (UI Resources, Nov 2025) still draft. Capability negotiated via `initialize.capabilities.extensions["io.modelcontextprotocol/ui"]`. **Strip widget metadata from non-widget clients** (`mcp/ext_apps.go` `stripUIResourceURIFromTools`) shipped at `ac18858`. | (same) | (same) | (same) | (same) |
| What MCP servers are configured user-scope? | `memory/mcp-servers.md` | 2026-03 | STALE-PENDING | `cat ~/.claude.json` |
| User-scope (`~/.claude.json`): memory, kokoro-tts, ralph-loop, gmail, workspace, gcloud, cclsp, tavily, gemini-cli, gemini-api. **gemini-cli uses Google Code Assist** (1000 req/day, all models). **gemini-api uses API key only** (250/day Flash only, Pro blocked). | (same) | (same) | (same) | (same) |

## §12 — Gap Analysis (questions we should be able to answer but no doc covers)

These gaps surfaced during inventory. Each is a candidate for a new memory note OR a new `.research/` doc.

| Gap | Why it matters | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **What's the OAUTH_JWT_SECRET rotation cadence and procedure?** | Mentioned in `memory/MEMORY.md` line 99 ("monthly rotation good hygiene") but no actual procedure documented. Item 2 prod-keys dr-drill assumes secret hasn't rotated; if it has, drill fails with exit-code 6. | Document procedure: how to generate new value (`openssl rand -hex 32`), how to coordinate with stored encrypted columns (re-encrypt or re-issue?), `flyctl secrets set OAUTH_JWT_SECRET=...`, how to re-run dr-drill after rotation. |
| **How many test functions does the binary actually have (compile-and-run authoritative count)?** | README claims vary (16,209 → 8,790 → ~9000 cumulative). Empirical: 4,881 in-tree + 4,089 in 28 algo2go modules = 8,970 if we sum. **No single canonical answer.** | Add `find . -name '*_test.go' -not -path './vendor/*' \| wc -l` + `grep -rE "^func Test" --include="*_test.go" . \| wc -l` to a CI workflow output that updates a README badge automatically. |
| **What's the exact procedure to provision GitHub Actions secrets for dr-drill.yml?** | `dr-drill-results-2026-05-11.md` finding (a): repo Actions secrets unset. Need: gh CLI commands to set the 6 secrets (4 R2 + 2 Telegram) idempotently. | Document: `gh secret set LITESTREAM_R2_ACCOUNT_ID --body "..."` etc. Include where to get values (Cloudflare R2 dashboard URL pattern). |
| **What's the implementation plan for `cmd/dr-decrypt-probe`?** | Referenced by `scripts/dr-drill-prod-keys.sh:147-166` but source doesn't exist. ~1-2hr Go work. Item 2 of launch playbook can't complete until this is built. | Add a stub design doc or open a GitHub issue with design + acceptance criteria. |
| **Has the smithery.yaml from `kite-launch-ready-fixes.md` actually been committed?** | Memory lists ready-to-commit content. Need `ls smithery.yaml` to verify. | Verify, then promote to memory if yes; or surface as TODO if no. |
| **What's the current Twitter follower count + GitHub star count?** | Both are launch triggers (≥50 stars for FLOSS/fund + Rainmatter). No doc tracks them. | Add a periodic probe: `gh repo view Sundeepg98/kite-mcp-server --json stargazerCount` + Twitter API or manual check. |
| **What's the funding.json status? Is it published in repo root?** | `kite-floss-fund.md` says publish funding.json in root. No verification doc. | `ls funding.json` + verify against https://floss.fund/funding-manifest/ schema. |
| **Where are the awesome-mcp-servers PRs (have we submitted)?** | `kite-awesome-mcp-listings.md` lists priority order but no submission log. | Add submission log doc tracking PR numbers + status per list. |
| **What's the current MRR (vs the ₹15-25k target)?** | `kite-mrr-reality.md` is the target; no doc tracks actual MRR. | At launch + paid users: track in a simple monthly snapshot doc. |
| **What's the Stripe / Razorpay billing integration status?** | Mentioned as "1-week effort" in `forward-tracks-strategic-review.md` Track 5.5 but no design doc. | Surface as a future research dispatch when paid-trial signals demand. |
| **What's the actual Twitter handle activity (last post date, follower count, engagement rate)?** | Identity anchor `@Sundeepg98` cited but no activity doc. | Add an empirical probe + manual periodic update. |
| **Is the Reddit `u/Sundeepg98` account created yet?** | `reddit-subreddit-specific-strategy.md` says NO as of 2026-05-02. Status today unknown. | `curl https://www.reddit.com/user/Sundeepg98/about.json` (404 = not created; 200 = created with karma data). |

## §13 — MEMORY.md Update Suggestions (surface only — do NOT commit yet)

The user's `MEMORY.md` line-limited index has gaps relative to the active research. Suggested additions (each <200 chars, one-line-per-topic format):

```
## Suggested additions to MEMORY.md (surfaced 2026-05-11; user to approve before adding)

# 2026-05 corpus + curation
- [2026-05-10 algo2go GitHub org CLAIMED](session_2026-05-10_path-a-complete.md) — 28 modules external; org created 2026-05-05 with 28 repos at github.com/algo2go (id 281974878); Sundeepg98 owner; Path A inauguration COMPLETE
- [2026-05-10 STATE.md canonical research index](state-md-canonical.md) — .research/STATE.md is the orchestrator's first-read; 14 active docs + 82 archived; question-keyed lookup at .research/INDEX.md
- [2026-05-11 grep-error correction](state-md-tools130-correction.md) — STATE.md `1e80930` had tools=130 grep error (counted test fixtures); patched at `bea1e11`. Methodology rule: compile-and-run > grep for any binary-state metric. Cost: ~6h misdirected synthesis.
- [2026-05-11 production = master modulo .research/-only](production-master-gap-report.md) — production at `bc5043e` matches master HEAD modulo doc-only commits; v1.3.0/tools=111 invariant verified by independent compile-and-run; "production stale" framing FALSIFIED across forward-tracks + final-pre-launch-verification.md
- [2026-05-11 R2 dr-drill state](dr-drill-results-2026-05-11.md) — backup chain healthy + salt preserved; 2 ops gaps: GitHub repo Actions secrets unset + cmd/dr-decrypt-probe source missing; both block playbook items #1+#2 until fixed
- [2026-05-11 active docs verification](active-docs-verification-2026-05-11.md) — 4 critical disagreements across 16 active docs; grep-error pattern propagated from STATE.md to forward-tracks/launch-playbooks/agent-domain-map/10000-agent — needs back-fill patches
```

Plus 4 standing rules to consider promoting to MEMORY.md User Rules section:

```
- [Compile-and-run > grep-and-count for binary-state metrics](feedback_compile_and_run_methodology.md) — grep over mixed code+test directories over-counts test fixtures; always read `total_available=N` startup log line OR `curl /healthz` to count tools/checks/etc. Pure grep is NOT authoritative.
- [Verify before recommend in synthesis docs](feedback_verify_before_synthesize.md) — when synthesis dispatch derives claims from earlier docs, re-verify load-bearing facts at HEAD. Otherwise grep-error / staleness propagates through dispatch chain (cost: ~6h misdirected synthesis observed in STATE.md tools=130 saga).
- [Date stamps required on synthesis claims](feedback_dated_synthesis.md) — every load-bearing claim in synthesis docs must cite a "Last verified" date OR be marked unverified/derived. Stale synthesis without dates cannot be re-checked efficiently.
- [Empirical-probe quick reference at .research/INDEX.md §11](feedback_empirical_probe_reference.md) — for any "what's X right now?" question, prefer the §11 single-line probes over re-deriving research. <30s answers for most production state questions.
```

## §14 — Orphan Docs (in archive, but referenced by hot-path)

Cross-checked active docs' references against `.research/archive/`. Findings:

| Archived doc | Referenced by (active) | Why kept | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|
| `archive/path-a-modules/path-a-*-pick.md` (28 files) | `memory/session_2026-05-10_path-a-complete.md` references arc-completion via filename pattern | Module-promotion mechanics for git-archaeology; Path A pattern is reusable for future similar work | KEEP in archive; no action needed |
| `archive/audits-completed/path-to-100*.md` | `memory/team-scaling-cost-benefit-per-axis.md` cites architecture 95.69 ceiling from these | Anchor doc for axis-ceiling calibration | KEEP in archive |
| `archive/tier-anchor-design/multi-repo-execute-or-defer.md` | `.research/forward-tracks-strategic-review.md` cites multi-repo decision context | Path A motivation context | KEEP in archive |
| `archive/audits-completed/_extracted-ux-audit.md` | `memory/team-scaling-cost-benefit-per-axis.md` cites UX 72→84 | Hire-trigger calibration anchor | KEEP in archive |
| `archive/session-scratch/observation-gate-analysis.md` | (not currently referenced from active docs) | Empirical falsification of 24h observation gate | KEEP — useful for future "why did we stop doing X?" questions |
| `archive/audits-completed/path-to-100-final.md` | `memory/team-scaling-cost-benefit-per-axis.md` cites scorecard | Hire-trigger anchor | KEEP |

**No orphan-with-broken-reference findings.** All archived docs that are referenced from hot-path active docs are findable via the archive index in `.research/STATE.md` §7.

## §15 — Maintenance Protocol for INDEX.md

This doc, like STATE.md, decays. To keep it useful:

### When to update INDEX.md

1. **A new question-class emerges** (a question we should be able to answer that has no row): add row + cite source.
2. **A doc gets archived**: update `Answer location` to `archive/<topic>/<file>.md` so the lookup still works.
3. **A claim's status changes** (FRESH → STALE-PENDING after 30d, or SUPERSEDED when patched): update `Last verified` + `Status` columns.
4. **An empirical probe path changes** (e.g., flyctl subcommand renamed): update `Probe path` column.

### When NOT to update INDEX.md

- Don't update on every commit; weekly cadence during pre-launch is fine.
- Don't add narrative-only rows that won't help future synthesis.
- Don't duplicate STATE.md content; INDEX.md is the lookup, STATE.md is the source-of-truth narrative.

### Quick-add template

```
| New question being asked? | `path/to/canonical/file.md` §section | YYYY-MM-DD | FRESH | `probe command` |
| Answer summary in next row (or inline if short). | (same) | (same) | (same) | (same) |
```

---

## §16 — Source Verification (this doc)

| Probe | Result | Tool used |
|---|---|---|
| `git pull --ff-only origin master` | up-to-date at `91d834f` | git |
| `ls .research/*.md` | 20 active md files (16 + 4 today's verifications/state-v2/diff/dr-drill) | ls |
| `ls .research/archive/<5 subdirs>/*.md` | 30 + 22 + 20 + 4 + 6 = 82 archived | ls |
| `ls C:/Users/Dell/.claude/projects/D--Sundeep-projects/memory/*.md` | 75 files (much more than dispatch said ~50) | ls |
| `ls D:/Sundeep/projects/kite-mcp-server/*.md` | 12 root-level (ARCHITECTURE, CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING, COVERAGE, PRIVACY, README, SECURITY, SECURITY_AUDIT_FINDINGS, SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT, SECURITY_PENTEST_RESULTS, TERMS, THREAT_MODEL) | ls |
| `ls D:/Sundeep/projects/kite-mcp-server/docs/` | 94 entries (88 .md + drafts/, evidence/, blog/, adr/, superpowers/) | ls |
| `ls D:/Sundeep/projects/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | 1 file (gh CLI rules) | ls |
| `ls D:/Sundeep/projects/kite-mcp-server/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | 1 file (TDD/architecture/middleware-chain rules) | ls |
| `curl https://kite-mcp-server.fly.dev/healthz` | `tools=111 version=v1.3.0 uptime=2h34m25s` (today) | curl |
| `curl -sIo /dev/null -w "HTTP %{http_code}" /og-image.png` | HTTP 200 | curl |
| `WebFetch rdap.verisign.com/com/v1/domain/algo2go.com` | HTTP 404 (still available) | WebFetch |
| `WebFetch api.github.com/orgs/algo2go` | HTTP 200, created 2026-05-05, 28 repos (CLAIMED) | WebFetch |

**Verification status of the INDEX itself**: each row's "Last verified" + "Status" columns are derived from the underlying doc's verification or empirical-probe date. INDEX.md inherits the staleness of its sources.

**Total questions indexed**: ~120 across §2-§10 (financial, regulatory, security, competition, technical, launch, brand, lessons, MCP ecosystem) + §11 (16 quick probes) + §12 (12 gap rows) + §13 (10 MEMORY.md suggestions) + §14 (6 orphan checks).

**Methodology rule applied throughout**: compile-and-run authoritative for tool counts (per STATE.md §11 lesson). Pure grep flagged as over-counting. Cross-references re-verified against current filesystem state.
