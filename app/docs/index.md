# Kite MCP

Connect your Zerodha account to AI assistants and get instant portfolio insights.

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a communication standard that enables AI assistants to interact with real-world data and services. Rather than relying only on pre-trained knowledge, AI tools can now access live information from your Zerodha account.

## Features

* **Real-time data access:** Access current market prices, not just historical data
* **Personalised insights:** Analyse your specific portfolio, not generic information
* **Interactive capabilities:** Retrieve precise information you need
* **Natural conversation:** Ask about complex market data in plain language

## Quick Start

Choose your preferred AI assistant:

- [Claude Desktop](/docs/clients/claude-desktop)
- [VS Code](/docs/clients/vscode)
- [Cursor](/docs/clients/cursor)

## What Can You Do?

- "Please group my open positions based on the underlying and calculate net delta of my option strategies"
- "Please provide a summary of today's market conditions including major index movements, sector performance, any notable news affecting my holdings, and stocks with unusual volume or price action."
- "What's the current price of Infosys stock? Show me the day's high and low, and compare its performance to the Nifty 50 today."


## Security and privacy

Zerodha takes security seriously with the Kite MCP implementation:

* **Limited access**: Claude can only access data you explicitly authorise
* **No credential storage**: Your Zerodha credentials never pass through Claude. Instead, authentication happens externally through Kite's secure two-factor authentication flow.
